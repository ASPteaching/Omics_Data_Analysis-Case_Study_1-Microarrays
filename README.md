# Omics_Data_Analysis-Case_Study_1-Microarrays
This repository contains an example of how to analyze microarrays data using bioconductor.

It is based on a Chapter on Microarray Data Analysis, written by Ricardo Gonzalo and myself, published in the book "Microarray Bioinformatics" edited by V. Bolon and Canedo in 2019.

In order to simplify the re-use of code I have broken the original document in two parts that I have renamed MDA1 and MDA2 (available soon). For each of this names there are three files available (familiarity with Rmarkdown and knittr is assumed)

* MDA?.Rmd: The Rmarkdown file to be run ("knitted" to be exact) 
* MDA?.html: The html output btained from knitting the previous markdown
* MDA?.R : The R code extracted from the markdown file with the instruction `purl` from the `kntr` package.
